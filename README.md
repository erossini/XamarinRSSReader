# Xamarin RSSReader

Our client wants to be able to read news articles from a
provided feed that can be shown in an app. They are not too
worried about how it looks, as long as it appears to be clean
and easy to read the news of the day.

The basic functionality of the app must be as follows:

- Load news articles from a public news feed
- Display a scrollable list of news articles
- Provide the option to filter news articles by category
(such as UK News and Technology news), where this
information is available
- Show a single news article on screen, using an HTML
display

The client is also interested in having additional
functionality, but this is not required:

- Provide the option to share news articles via email and/or
social networks
- Display a thumbnail of each article in the list of
articles
- Present news articles in the order in which they are
published
- Download articles so they can be read offline

Because we donâ€™t know where the client is actually going to
source their news from, they have told us to use at least one
of the following news feeds to read this data from:

- http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml (BBC News UK)
- http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/technology/rss.xml (BBC News
Technology)
- http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/UKdomesticNews?format=xml
(Reuters UK)
- http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/technologyNews?format=xml
(Reuters Technology)
